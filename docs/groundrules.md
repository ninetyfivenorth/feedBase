## Groundrules

What you need to know about privacy and how feedBase works.

### Everything is public

All the information you upload to feedBase is public. 

This is a publishing system. 

### We use Twitter for ID

We only use Twitter for two things:

1. To associate a unique name with each user, so we can store each user's subscriptions separately from other users' subscriptions. 

2. We will ask Twitter for public profile information, possibly so we can fill in some feedBase defaults for you, using those values. 

feedBase will not post on your behalf, read any of your Twitter messages, posts, see who your friends are, unless you ask us to, through the use of a command that clearly confirms what it is going to do. At this point there are no commands that do any of this. 

### Upload as many OPML files as you like

You may use more than one feed reader, or may have OPML files from different time periods. You can upload as many as you like. feedBase will parse the files, extract the subscriptions and add them to the database under your name. 

You can always get back the OPML of the feeds you've checked on feedBase through a public OPML file, that you can then use to submit feeds to feed readers. You can use feedBase to maintain your subscription list. That's a new feature, that wasn't present in earlier versions. You can view this file with the <i>View my OPML</i> command in the Main menu.

I recommend keeping all your subscriptions in a single file, which makes it easy to edit, and if you need to start over, it's easy to reload your subscriptions by simply reloading that file.
