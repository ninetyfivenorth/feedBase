## Groundrules

What you need to know about privacy and how feedBase works.

### Everything is public

Everything you upload to feedBase and the fact that it was you who uploaded it is public information.

We want to learn about new feeds, about what's popular, and we're not sure what else. That can't work without the information being publicly accessible.

### We use Twitter for ID

But we will not read any of your messages, posts, see who your friends are, unless you ask us to, through use of a command. 

We will ask Twitter for public profile information, so we can fill in some feedBase defaults for you, using those values.
