## What is feedBase?

A project to get lots of feeds into a database.

### How it works

Each user has a single OPML file containing their subscriptions. You can edit the file as you wish. When your outline changes your subscriptions are added to a database of the subscriptions of all other Scripting News readers. Then we compile a top 100 list so we can see who everyone else subscribes to and find other interesting sites. 

### Why?

The blogosphere needs glue. We'll never know how much stuff is going on until we start looking for it. In a sense it's like the first time around, when we put out feelers of different kinds. Some worked others didn't. I remember this approach working really well.

### Open source

The database is open source so if other communities want to run their own feedBases, you're welcome to. It requires a MySQL database and a little bit of configuration. I'll write docs for that when it's time to lock things down. 

### Ideas

There are lots of ideas. I want to write some of them down here.
